		<strong>What Kind of Experience Are You Looking For?</strong><br>
		<em>By Amardeep Parmar on September 30, 2020, 5:22 PM </em>

			For anyone outside of the obstacle course racing world, there seems to be only one logical reason people compete: they’re masochists.
In reality, there’s a huge variety of reasons why people participate in a race. You can go through the day with no pain at all if you choose to or push your body to its limit. The most important thing is that your effort matches your training and intention.
If you’re just running for a fun day out with some friends and to get a picture for Instagram, you don’t need to break yourself. You can take the course leisurely and soak up the atmosphere. But you’ll need to train harder and make more sacrifices if your time matters more to you. The worst thing to do would be to put yourself through the misery of extreme training when you don’t care about the time it takes you to complete the race.
Now, hopefully, you haven’t already signed up for the aptly named Spartan Death Race after being inactive for the past ten years. There’s little point in targeting a race that’s well beyond your current capabilities. You won’t enjoy it and it may just dishearten you.
In the Wolf Run, I ran with several first-time runners who were of average fitness. It was the perfect race for them to start with, with less pressure and a fun vibe. For the Spartan Beast, I ran with one first-time runner who had run three marathons before that. Although it was his first obstacle course race, he had an extraordinarily high fitness level and I struggled to keep up.

		<strong>Fast downhill, slow uphill</strong><br>
		<em>By Amardeep Parmar on September 30, 2020, 4:08 PM</em>

			One secret that allowed me to improve my time is attacking downhill sections and being more conservative on uphills. As mentioned, our brains know what they are doing with calculating running routes. If you allow yourself to fly downhill, you’ll pass your more conservative competitors. You must train this beforehand so you are comfortable executing this in the race. It feels unnatural at first as we aren’t used to trusting our bodies in this way.
In races, uphill portions can have extreme inclines. Putting all your energy into these sections can leave you exhausted without having much to show for it. It’s far smarter to save your energy to attack the downhill. We have limited energy to use during a race even with drink and snack breaks so efficiency is key. You know your own body best and when you have any concerns about potential injuries, consult a medical professional.
Train with your teammates
If you are running with a team then train together. It’s fantastic for relationship building and you get a sense of each other’s abilities before the big day. One of the hardest aspects for the beginner is how to pace the race because it’s not the same as a normal run. The mental health benefits of running with a group are comparable to group therapy
