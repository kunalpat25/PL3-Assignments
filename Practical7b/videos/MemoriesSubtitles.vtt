00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:13.610
Here′s to the ones that we got

00:00:13.714 --> 00:00:16.113
Chers to the wish you were
here but You are not

00:00:16.215 --> 00:00:18.514
′Cause the drinks bring
back all the memories

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.609
Of everything we′ve been through

00:00:21.703 --> 00:00:24.002
Toast to the ones here today

00:00:24.118 --> 00:00:26.617
Toast to the ones that
we lost on the way

00:00:26.705 --> 00:00:29.104
′Cause the drinks bring
back all the memories

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.009
And the memories bring back

00:00:31.103 --> 00:00:33.152
Memories bring back you

00:00:33.212 --> 00:00:38.311
There′s a time that I remember
when I did not know no pain

00:00:38.403 --> 00:00:40.902
When I believed in forever

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.509
And everything would stay the same

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:46.208
Now my heart feel like December

00:00:46.314 --> 00:00:48.813
When somebody say your name

00:00:48.917 --> 00:00:51.616
′Cause I can′t reach out to call you

00:00:51.708 --> 00:00:54.907
But I know I will one day

00:00:55.007 --> 00:01:00.406
Everybody hurts sometimes‚
everybody hurts someday

00:01:00.516 --> 00:01:05.415
Everything will be alright‚ go
on raise a glass and say

00:01:05.505 --> 00:01:07.304
Here′s to the ones that we got

00:01:07.414 --> 00:01:10.313

here but You are not

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.608

There′s a time that I remember
when I never felt so lost

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.309
When I felt that all the hatred
was too powerful to stop

00:01:48.413 --> 00:01:50.812
Now my heart feel like an ember

00:01:50.918 --> 00:01:53.617
And it is lighting up the dark

00:01:53.713 --> 00:01:56.312
